# 🧙‍♂️ PotterGPT: Harry Potter Character-Level Text Generator

This project implements a **character-level Transformer language model** trained on Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (my favourite btw:)) and deployed using a **Gradio web interface**. The model learns to generate coherent text character-by-character, mimicking the writing style of the training corpus.

⚠️ **Built entirely from scratch** — no pre-trained models or high-level libraries like Hugging Face Transformers were used.

## 📌 Features

- From-scratch implementation of a Transformer language model  
- Character-level text generation  
- Trained on Harry Potter text  
- Interactive Gradio web interface  
- Lightweight and easy to run on local machines
