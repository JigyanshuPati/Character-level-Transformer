# 🧙‍♂️ PotterGPT: Harry Potter Character-Level Text Generator

This project implements a **character-level Transformer language model** trained on Harry Potter-style text and deployed using a **Gradio web interface**. The model learns to generate coherent text character-by-character, mimicking the writing style of the training corpus.

⚠️ **Built entirely from scratch** — no pre-trained models or high-level libraries like Hugging Face Transformers were used. This project serves as an educational and minimal working example of how a Transformer works under the hood.

## 📌 Features

- From-scratch implementation of a Transformer language model  
- Character-level text generation  
- Trained on Harry Potter text
